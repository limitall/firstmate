# The raw walk answers "did MY session acquire the lock" only where the harness

# holds - a bash under the native Windows harness reports PPID=1, and the
# harness pid the lock records has no MSYS presence at all - so an already
# locked session would be nudged to lock again on every SessionStart. Fall back
# to the shared owner of that decision, which resolves the same identity the
# lock was written with. Where the walk works it still answers first, so no
# platform pays for a second resolution it does not need.
